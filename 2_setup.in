.h2 Setup

Install the LIRCD-package. Although we're note using the
.fixed lircd,
the package contains some support programs etc. that we will be using.

.pre
sudo apt install lircd
.pre

Next, make sure that the receiver and sender devices are available. For 
the Anavi pHAT, that means you'll need the add the following lines to
.fixed /boot/firmware/config.txt

.pre
#LIRC
dtoverlay=gpio-ir-tx,gpio_pin=17
dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=18
.pre

and reboot.

Next start the server.

.pre
perl server.pl
.pre

At this point, there are no remotes available.
When you have cloned a remote, it will be available under
.i servername:3000/remotename.html.
You might restart if the server crashes like:

.pre
while : ; do
    perl server.pl
done
.pre

or even use
.fixed systemd
to restart it again.
