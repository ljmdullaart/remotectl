.h1 Intro

Remotectl is a set of scripts that allow the cloning of multiple 
remote controls on a single Raspberry Pi with Anavi IR pHAT. 
The scripts use the raw receive and send from the
.fixed lircd
so it should work with other IR receivers/transmitters as well.

The server is meant to run on a closed network and has no security
at all.
